Xpadder-config
==============

This is my config file for using [Xpadder](http://www.xpadder.com/) on Windows. Has controller configuration and profiles.

Currently, I use a Razer Onza Tournament Edition, which is pretty nice. Ironically, I have never owned any Xbox console. I just find the controller more comfortable than generic PC controllers, and it lets me avoid the evil that is MotionInJoy (for connecting PS3 controllers to PC). I could never get Bluetooth working on my old laptop for devices other than PS3 controllers after installing it, bbecause it rips out the default Windows drivers and replaces them with its own.

If I own new controllers, I'll upload their profiles too.


I took a lot of inspiration from [this Lifehacker article](http://lifehacker.com/5883374/how-i-improved-my-life-with-a-ps3-controller).
